            <p >I'm a Senior at UTSA. I'm a computer science major, taking electives towards my concentration in cyber security. I grew up here in San Antonio mostly, albeit I did spend time
                in Dallas as well. Additionally I went to John Marshall High School and that's where I discovered my love for software development. This was through the design of a robot for
                the robotics club, wherein we had to write the Java code for it's Lego Mindstorms "brain" so as to make it distinguish colors, move, and so on. After graduating high school
                I worked part time at the grocery store, then tutored math at the community college.
            </p>
            <p > This summer I worked with a local infosec contractor as an intern, Raz-logic llc. Notably I helped patch up security holes in their website and integrate their file system
                with AWS. The internship not only allowed my the opportunity to learn best practices and apply knowledge from the classroom, but also build valuable connections.Because of
                this I gained a demonstrable knowledge of secure software design techniques and practices. Additionally I would also like to mention that I have experience with programming
                languages Java, C, C++, and scripting languages bash and python in Linux secure shell, as well as CSS, html, and PHP with Web development.</p>
